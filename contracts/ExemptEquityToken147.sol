/**
 * Intrastate: Rule 147
 * --------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings
 *
 * Rule 147 is considered a “safe harbor” under Section 3(a)(11),
 * providing objective standards that a company can rely on to meet the requirements of
 * that exemption. Rule 147, as amended, has the following requirements:
 *
 *  - the company must be organized in the state where it offers and sells securities
 *  - the company must have its “principal place of business” in-state and satisfy at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the in-state
 *    nature of the company’s business
 *  - offers and sales of securities can only be made to in-state residents or persons who the company reasonably believes are in-state residents and
 *  - the company obtains a written representation from each purchaser providing the residency of that purchaser
 *
 * Securities purchased in an offering under Rule 147 limit resales to persons residing within the state of the offering for a period of six months
 * from the date of the sale by the issuer to the purchaser. In addition, a company must comply with state securities laws and regulations in the states
 * in which securities are offered or sold.
 * 
 * Intrastate: Rule 147A
 * ---------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings
 *
 * Rule 147A is a new intrastate offering exemption adopted by the Commission in
 * October 2016. Rule 147A is substantially identical to Rule 147 except that Rule 147A:
 *
 *  - allows offers to be accessible to out-of-state residents, so long sales are only made to in-state residents and
 *  - permits a company to be incorporated or organized out-of-state, so long as the company has its “principal place of business” in-state
 *    and satisfies at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the in-state nature of the company’s business
 */

/**
* Under 147
* ---------
* Example: a company must be incorporated and doing business in Florida and can only offer a private equity exempt offering to the residents of
* Florida ONLY!
*
* Under 147-A
* -----------
* Example: a company may be incorporated in Delaware and doing business in Florida, and hence may offer private equity sales in Florida as long as
* they meet the "doing business" criteria. If business meets the "doing business" requirement for both states, then a private equity offering
* may be offered to the residents of both the state of Delaware and Florida.
