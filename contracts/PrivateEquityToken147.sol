/**
 * Intrastate: Rule 147
 * --------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings 
 *
 * Rule 147 is considered a “safe harbor” under Section 3(a)(11), 
 * providing objective standards that a company can rely on to meet the requirements of 
 * that exemption. Rule 147, as amended, has the following requirements:
 *
 *  - the company must be organized in the state where it offers and sells securities
 *  - the company must have its “principal place of business” in-state and satisfy at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the in-state nature of the company’s business
 *  - offers and sales of securities can only be made to in-state residents or persons who the company reasonably believes are in-state residents and
 *  - the company obtains a written representation from each purchaser providing the residency of that purchaser
 *
 * Securities purchased in an offering under Rule 147 limit resales to persons residing 
 * within the state of the offering for a period of six months from the date of the sale 
 * by the issuer to the purchaser. In addition, a company must comply with state securities 
 * laws and regulations in the states in which securities are offered or sold.
