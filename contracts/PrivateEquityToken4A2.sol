/**
 * Section 4(a)(2)
 * ---------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506b
 *
 * To qualify for this exemption, which is sometimes referred to as the “private placement”
 * exemption, the purchasers of the securities must
 *
 *  - either have enough knowledge and experience in finance and business matters to be
 *    “sophisticated investors” (able to evaluate the risks and merits of the investment),
 *    or be able to bear the investment’s economic risk
 *  - have access to the type of information normally provided in a prospectus for a
 *    registered securities offering and
 *  - agree not to resell or distribute the securities to the public
 *
 * In general, public advertising of the offering, and general solicitation of investors,
 * is incompatible with the private placement exemption.
 *
 * The precise limits of the private placement exemption are not defined by rule.
 * As the number of purchasers increases and their relationship to the company and
 * its management becomes more remote, it is more difficult to show that the offering
 * qualifies for this exemption. If your company offers securities to even one person
 * who does not meet the necessary conditions, the entire offering may be in violation
 * of the Securities Act.
