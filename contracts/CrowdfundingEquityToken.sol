 * Regulation Crowdfunding; Section 4(a)(6)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/rccomplianceguide-051316.htm
 *
 * c. Transactions Conducted Through an Intermediary
 *
 * Each Regulation Crowdfunding offering must be exclusively conducted through one online platform. The intermediary operating the platform must be a broker-dealer
 * or a funding portal that is registered with the SEC and FINRA.
 *
 * Issuers may rely on the efforts of the intermediary to determine that the aggregate amount of securities purchased by an investor does not cause the investor
 * to exceed the investment limits, so long as the issuer does not have knowledge that the investor would exceed the investment limits as a result of purchasing
 * securities in the issuerâ€™s offering.
