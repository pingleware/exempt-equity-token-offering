/**
 * Intrastate: Rule 147A
 * ---------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings 
 *
 * Rule 147A is a new intrastate offering exemption adopted by the Commission in 
 * October 2016. Rule 147A is substantially identical to Rule 147 except that Rule 147A:
 *
 *  - allows offers to be accessible to out-of-state residents, 
 *    so long sales are only made to in-state residents and
 *  - permits a company to be incorporated or organized out-of-state, 
 *    so long as the company has its “principal place of business” in-state and 
 *    satisfies at least one “doing business” requirement that demonstrates the 
 *    in-state nature of the company’s business
