/**
 * Intrastate:Section 3(a)(11)
 * ---------------------------
 * See https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/intrastateofferings 
 *
 * Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act is generally known as the 
 * “intrastate offering exemption.” This exemption seeks to facilitate the financing of 
 * local business operations. To qualify for the intrastate offering exemption, 
 * a company must:
 *
 *   - be organized in the state where it is offering the securities
 *   - carry out a significant amount of its business in that state and
 *   - make offers and sales only to residents of that state
 *
 * The intrastate offering exemption does not limit the size of the offering or the number 
 * of purchasers. A company must determine the residence of each offeree and purchaser. 
 * If any of the securities are offered or sold to even one out-of-state person, 
 * the exemption may be lost. Without the exemption, the company would be in violation 
 * of the Securities Act if the offering does not qualify for another exemption.
