## Why is a CUSIP number needed for Equity Offerings?
When an equity offering is launch, the purpose of the equity offering is to sell stock in a company. When an investor buys equity in a company, whether through a public or private offering, they expect to receive a stock certificate. In today's world of online trading, stock certificates are no longer issued to the shareholder but their transaction is still recorded. Each stock certificate issued is associated with the an offering. To help keep track of which stock certificate is related to the offering, a CUSIP number is assigned to the offering and that CUSIP number becomes the prefix for the stock certificate number. 

In blockchain equity token transactions, the token or transaction ID or hash can be the suffix for the stock certificate issued.

For example, a new stock certificate could have a number in the format of,

    CUSIP-TOKEN_TRANSACTION_HASH

For restricted securities, the stock certificates have a RESTRICTED image overlaid on the certtificate.
