# Exempt Equity Offering
(includes private placement offerings)

A traditional private placement offering involves filing a FORM D on the SEC.GOV EDGAR filing system, creating a private placement memorandum and then searching for qualified and accredited investors. Prior to cryptocurrency and blockchain, liquidity in the private equity markets was limited until the company initiated an IPO. Under rule 144, creates liquidity in a private equity offering after twelve months from each sale of restricted securities. Using cryptocurrency for the private equity offering on the Ethereum network can create compliance liquidity before an IPO as well as generate a market value.

(THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPINIONS, SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION, etc. AND NOT LEGAL NOR INVESTMENT ADVICE!)

The introduction to equity trading tokens on the etheruem network make the search for accredited investors easier because liquidity is possible after the first twelve months of the offering under Rule 144. The market rate of the equity is established when the accredited investors have resold their holdings after twelve months have lapsed. Establishing a market rate in a private equity offering can prevent exorbitant valuations when a full IPO/DPO via a S-1 becomes effective.

Issuing preferred stock only during the private equity offering adds protection for the investors by placing them in a protected class similar to creditors, so in the event of court-ordered liquidation, the company assets can be sold to recover preferred equity investors funds.

A private equity offering should limit the maximum preferred shares to 10% of the total authorized shares specified in the company's charter, otherwise additional reporting requirements will be needed when new investors are vested. For example, a company with 1,000,000 authorized shares listed in it's charter, should limit private equity preferred outstanding shares to 100,000. The remaining 900,000 authorized shares can used for other offerings at a later date.

From https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506c

Rule 506(c) permits issuers to broadly solicit and generally advertise an offering, provided that:

- all purchasers in the offering are accredited investors
- the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify purchasers’ accredited investor status and
- certain other conditions in Regulation D are satisfied

## What are restricted securities?
From: https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/faq

“Restricted securities” are previously-issued securities held by security holders that are not freely tradable. Securities Act Rule 144(a)(3) identifies what offerings produce restricted securities. After such a transaction, the security holders can only resell the securities into the market by using an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or a valid exemption from registration for the resale, such as Rule 144.

Rule 144 is a "safe harbor" under Section 4(a)(1) providing objective standards that a security holder can rely on to meet the requirements of that exemption. Rule 144 permits the resale of restricted securities if a number of conditions are met, including holding the securities for six months or one year, depending on whether the issuer has been filing reports under the Exchange Act. Rule 144 may limit the amount of securities that can be sold at one time and may restrict the manner of sale, depending on whether the security holder is an affiliate. An affiliate of a company is a person that, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the company.

EIP-2569 can also be use to save a stock certificate with the token sale on the blockchain when the investment is first made.

### Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities
From: https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsrule144htm.html

When you acquire restricted securities or hold control securities, you must find an exemption from the SEC's registration requirements to sell them in a public marketplace. Rule 144 allows public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are met. This overview tells you what you need to know about selling your restricted or control securities. It also describes how to have a restrictive legend removed.

#### What Are Restricted and Control Securities?
Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private sales from the issuing company or from an affiliate of the issuer. Investors typically receive restricted securities through private placement offerings, Regulation D offerings, employee stock benefit plans, as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the company. Rule 144(a)(3) identifies what sales produce restricted securities.

Control securities are those held by an affiliate of the issuing company. An affiliate is a person, such as an executive officer, a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. Control means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. If you buy securities from a controlling person or "affiliate," you take restricted securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands.

If you acquire restrictive securities, you almost always will receive a certificate stamped with a "restrictive" legend. The legend indicates that the securities may not be resold in the marketplace unless they are registered with the SEC or are exempt from the registration requirements. Certificates for control securities usually are not stamped with a legend.

#### What Are the Conditions of Rule 144?
If you want to sell your restricted or control securities to the public, you can meet the applicable conditions set forth in Rule 144. The rule is not the exclusive means for selling restricted or control securities, but provides a "safe harbor" exemption to sellers. The rule's five conditions are summarized below:

Additional securities purchased from the issuer do not affect the holding period of previously purchased securities of the same class. If you purchased restricted securities from another non-affiliate, you can tack on that non-affiliate's holding period to your holding period. For gifts made by an affiliate, the holding period begins when the affiliate acquired the securities and not on the date of the gift. In the case of a stock option, including employee stock options, the holding period begins on the date the option is exercised and not the date it is granted.

1. Holding Period. Before you may sell any restricted securities in the marketplace, you must hold them for a certain period of time. If the company that issued the securities is a “reporting company” in that it is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then you must hold the securities for at least six months. If the issuer of the securities is not subject to the reporting requirements, then you must hold the securities for at least one year. The relevant holding period begins when the securities were bought and fully paid for. The holding period only applies to restricted securities. Because securities acquired in the public market are not restricted, there is no holding period for an affiliate who purchases securities of the issuer in the marketplace. But the resale of an affiliate's shares as control securities is subject to the other conditions of the rule.
2. Current Public Information.  There must be adequate current information about the issuing company publicly available before the sale can be made. For reporting companies, this generally means that the companies have complied with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For non-reporting companies, this means that certain company information, including information regarding the nature of its business, the identity of its officers and directors, and its financial statements, is publicly available.
3. Trading Volume Formula. If you are an affiliate, the number of equity securities you may sell during any three-month period cannot exceed the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold, or if the class is listed on a stock exchange, the greater of 1% or the average reported weekly trading volume during the four weeks preceding the filing of a notice of sale on Form 144.  Over-the-counter stocks, including those quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, can only be sold using the 1% measurement.
4. Ordinary Brokerage Transactions.  If you are an affiliate, the sales must be handled in all respects as routine trading transactions, and brokers may not receive more than a normal commission.  Neither the seller nor the broker can solicit orders to buy the securities.
Filing a Notice of Proposed Sale With the SEC.  If you are an affiliate, you must file a notice with the SEC on Form 144 if the sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period.

#### If I Am Not an Affiliate of the Issuer, What Conditions of Rule 144 Must I Comply With?
If you are not (and have not been for at least three months) an affiliate of the company issuing the securities and have held the restricted securities for at least one year, you can sell the securities without regard to the conditions in Rule 144 discussed above.  If the issuer of the securities is subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements and you have held the securities for at least six months but less than one year, you may sell the securities as long as you satisfy the current public information condition.

#### Can the Securities Be Sold Publicly If the Conditions of Rule 144 Have Been Met?
Even if you have met the conditions of Rule 144, you can't sell your restricted securities to the public until you've gotten the legend removed from the certificate. Only a transfer agent can remove a restrictive legend. But the transfer agent won't remove the legend unless you've obtained the consent of the issuer—usually in the form of an opinion letter from the issuer's counsel—that the restrictive legend can be removed. Unless this happens, the transfer agent doesn't have the authority to remove the legend and permit execution of the trade in the marketplace.

To begin the legend removal process, an investor should contact the company that issued the securities, or the transfer agent for the securities, to ask about the procedures for removing a legend. Removing the legend can be a complicated process requiring you to work with an attorney who specializes in securities law.

## Resale of Restricted Securities
From: https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/rules144-145-secg.htm

In accordance with the Rule 144 compliance guide, no restricted securities may be resold during the first six months after the commencement of the offering; investors may resell their restricted securities after six months of the offering but before the first year (12 months) have lapse as long as Rule 144 reporting requirements have been satisfied; after the offering has lapsed for twelve months (1 year), unlimited public resale of restricted securities may commence without Rule 144 compliance.

Important note: Only accredited investors can buy shares in 506(c) offering and those accredited investors may sell their holdings freely in the open market after they have held the shares for at least 12 months from the date they fully paid for the shares. For example, a company creates a private equity offering through the ethereum network, only 1% of the outstanding shares are sold in the first twelve months, then in month 15 another institutional investor buys 10% of the outstanding shares. That insttitutional investor must wait for 12 months after the payment for the shares is received before they can offer for sale to the public.

A possible strategy to introduce new private equity offering and generate a market price after twelve months is for the founder to purchase a minimum of outstanding shares at the time that the offering commences (cannot exceed 1% of the outstanding. e.g. 1% of 100,000 = 1,000 - this rule prevents a pump-n-dump scenario by the insiders), filing the SEC Form 3 as required, then wait for 12 months, submitting reports during the wait period, then offering their outstanding shares to the public, filing the SEC Form 4, keeping in mind that the market price must be at least the par value amount. The founder shares could be offered on a secondary ethereum exchange which creates a market price that can be used is market valuations and attract additional accredited investors to the private equity offering? If only the founder invested in the private equity offering for the first twelve months, the company's public float is still zero until the founder resells their outstanding shares on the secondary market. [the purpose of this strategy is to obtain a merket value when interest in the private equity offering is very low?]

A possible secondary market for private equity offering for allowable sales is through LedgerDex.com see more at https://www.ledgerdex.com/about/. Conversion between ETH and WETH must be included in the smart contract, as well as the allowance permission must be in compliance with secondary resales of private equity offerrings.

Other exchanges for acredited investors to sell private equity tokens include,

    Uniswap (https://uniswap.exchange) https://www.leewayhertz.com/tokens-on-uniswap-exchange
    Changelly (https://changelly.com/for-tokens)
    List a Token (https://listatoken.com/)
    Second BTC (https://secondbtc.com/market)
    IDEX (https://idex.io/)
    EtherDelta (https://etherdelta.com/)

Keep in mind, that private equity tokens may only be sold publicly after the accredited investor has held them for 12 months.

WARNING!
UNLESS THE FOUNDER IN THE ABOVE SCENARIO COMMITS TO FULL DISCLOSURE INCLUDE VOLUNTARY QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REPORTING, THEIR ATTEMPTS TO CREATE MARKET VALUE COULD BE CONCEIVED AS A PUMP-AND-DUMP SCHEME AND BE SUBJECT TO SEC ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

# Workflow Plan
The following is a high order overview of the workflow plan,

    1. Develop a suitable smart contract that meets the requirements for Reg D Rule 506C on the Ethereum test network
    2. Out source an independent audit of the smart contract
    3. Prepare the Private Placement Memorandum with an attorney review and correction, if needed?
    4. Create a new Form D filing on SEC EDGAR Filing system with references to this code repository
    5. Submit the Solicitation Materials Used in Rule 506(c) Offerings to https://www.sec.gov/forms/rule506c#no-back
    6. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum main net
    7. Contact preselected accredited investors.

# Other Implementations
Performing the following searches reveal other open source implementations,

## Par Value
The value of a company's stock as defined in the registration documents such as the Article of Incorporation. The par value is the minimum price that a company has deemed their equity may be sold. Placing a high par value raises the bar of valuation. Depending on the juisdiction of incorporation, a company's franchise tax liability may be affected by the par value assigned?

## Book Value
The value of a company based on their accounting records (or books) taking into consideration sales, expenses, and assets. The book value should be greater than the total par value which is the product of the total shares and par value price.

## Market Value
The value (price) of a company share that an investor will purchase shares of the company where the minimum price is determined by the par value. Also the most speculative pricing! Supply, Demand, Emotions (FMO) and Greed are drive market pricing. 

## Common Stock
From: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/

Common stock represents shares of ownership in a corporation and the type of stock in which most people invest. When people talk about stocks, they are usually referring to common stock. In fact, the great majority of stock is issued in this form.

Common shares represent a claim on profits (dividends) and confer voting rights. Investors most often get one vote per share owned to elect board members who oversee the major decisions made by management. Stockholders thus have the ability to exercise control over corporate policy and management issues compared to preferred shareholders.

## Preferred Stock
From: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/

One main difference from common stock is that preferred stock comes with no voting rights. So when it comes time for a company to elect a board of directors or vote on any form of corporate policy, preferred shareholders have no voice in the future of the company. In fact, preferred stock functions similarly to bonds since with preferred shares, investors are usually guaranteed a fixed dividend in perpetuity.

The dividend yield of a preferred stock is calculated as the dollar amount of a dividend divided by the price of the stock. This is often based on the par value before a preferred stock is offered. It's commonly calculated as a percentage of the current market price after it begins trading. This is different from common stock, which has variable dividends that are declared by the board of directors and never guaranteed. In fact, many companies do not pay out dividends to common stock at all.

## Authorized Shares
The number of authorized shares can be substantially greater than the number of shares outstanding since authorized shares represents the maximum possible number of shares a company can issue. The outstanding number of shares may be either equal to or less than the number of authorized shares. This is the number of shares specified in the company's charter.

## Shares Outstanding
Outstanding shares represent the number of a company’s shares that are traded on a primary or secondary market and, therefore, available to investors. Outstanding shares include all restricted shares held by the company’s officers and insiders (senior employees), as well as the equity portion owned by institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds.

## Floating Shares (aka Public float)
The number of shares outstanding minus closely-held shares – a large number of shares that are held by one party, be it an individual or a small group of controlling shareholders, such as officers or directors of the company.

## Cancelled Shares
When a company cancels shares, thus reducing the total available number of shares. This action is non-reversible.

## Treasury Shares
When a company buys back shares from the investors.

## Private Placement Memorandum
Is like a prospectus for private equity offerings. If you have set a high a par value say $5 per share and allocated 100,000 shares for your private equity offering, the minimum valuation is $500,000. If your company does not have $500,000 in assets, you may wish to specify in your private placement memorandum "use of proceeds," a budget to acquired assets to increase total company net asset value above $500,000?
